Weather website of hikers

Competitive Analysis

The first website I looked at was mountain-forecast.com. It’s kind of the same idea that looks at weather and precipitation, only it encompasses entire mountains instead of a specific trailhead. It doesn’t look like there is any evidence of Bootstrap being used. I see ‘googletag” being used which allows Google's advertising. 
																										The second website is Opensummit. It is similar to mountain-forecast only they have a subscription model if you want to see the forecast past the next two days, otherwise it is locked away and the user can’t see the other days.  They seem to call their homepage the ‘front page’ in html. It also doesn’t look like they used Bootstrap. 

The third website I decided to compare is AllTrails. It’s not a weather forecast website but it utilizes a trail review system where the user can look at recent reviews to determine the current condition of said trail in a particular season. It also uses a timeline like a social media website of trails you previously visited and logged on the site or app. Under their gear shop tab, they used JavaScript to code the popup animations for the items for sale. 

GitHub Repository Research


The first GitHub repository relevant to my project is FairWeatherHiker. It is almost the same idea as mine but doesn’t include snowfall or accumulated precipitation. A good bit of Bootstrap was used for the css code. They added a navigation bar and drop down with a btn group. Google’s API is used for map data. An entire folder of jpg files is present for backdrop on the website. 

The second GitHub repository is Outdoor-Adventure-App. The user inputs a desired city and a five-day weather forecast with nearby trails is returned. There is an image folder as well. Various third party API’s are used such as Google Maps, wunderground, hikingproject.com and mountainproject.com.
